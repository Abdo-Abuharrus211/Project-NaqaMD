# Project NaqaMD 
The Markdown to HTML converter built in OCaml.

## Idea
I needed to convert Obsidian notes to HTML pages so I made a little tool. <br>
I chose OCaml because I was learning the language and felt like its Pattern Matching would be a great fit for this purpose.

## Instructions


## What's next?
- Implement conversion for more complex MD elements and notation.
- Associate a stylesheet to the output HTML.
